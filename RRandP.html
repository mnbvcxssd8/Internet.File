   <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">RR and P stands for Routers, Redundacy, and Packets; all components that help to connect your computer to the internet.</p>
        <img src = "router.webp" width = 60% height = 20%>
        <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">-Routers use IP addresses to transfer data along direct connections between your computer and the internet.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">-Redundancy is the repitition in computer science where the message or package is sent multiple times. When the direct connections between your computer, the destination, and the conditions of the internet are unpredictable then the router must find another route or a more unpredictable path. This is called working dynamically. With reduncancy, the computer can find a working route more often.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">-Packets are the pieces or segments of information that make up a larger message. Data, computer requests, and messages are sent in the form of packets. Packets contain anywhere between 64 and 1500 bytes each. Metadata included in the package might include an IP address or numbers so the destination knows both who the message is from and the order the packets need to be sent in </p>
