        <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">The internet is the complex passageways that allow a computer to have access to the World Wide Web (WWW) and its databases.</p>
         <img src = "int2.jpg" width = 60% height = 20%>
        <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;">-Many people confuse the internet and the WWW but the internet is actually just the layers and paths that lead a computer to the WWW. It is made of many protocols that are designed to help the computer work at a large scale where billions of devices can communicate with one another.</p>
       <p style="font-family:Garamond; font-size:130%;"> -Package requests are transfered through the internet to collect data from the WWW to send back through the internet to the device that requested the data. </p>
